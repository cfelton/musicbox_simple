===============

This is a simple "musicbox" FPGA (HDL) example inspired by a reddit question.

A simple look-up-table audio "note" generation is created with an hardware description suitable for an FPGA implementation.  An [IPython notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/cfelton/musicbox_simple/blob/master/musicbox.ipynb) (click to view the IPython notebook on nbviewer) was used to simulated the design and evaluate the output.
